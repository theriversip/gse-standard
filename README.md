## Personal Pronouns
### Subject

| Person     | Singular | Plural |
| ---------- | -------- | ------ |
| 1st person | I        | we     |
| 2nd person | you      | yall   |
| 3rd person | he / she | they   |

### Object

| Person     | Singular  | Plural |
| ---------- | --------- | ------ |
| 1st person | me        | us     |
| 2nd person | you       | yall   |
| 3rd person | him / her | them   |

Object pronouns show case leveling (e.g., me and him went). 
## Double Subjects
The GSE double subject construction usually takes the form `(noun / noun phrase), (pronoun clause / pronoun + verb phrase)`.
#### Examples:

| Structure                               | Implied Function                   |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| My sister, she own a boutique.          | Character emphasis or identity cue |
| The students, they graduated yesterday. | Group description                  |
| The bus on this route, it be on time.   | Habitual behavior                  |
| The man from the office, where'd he go? | Location + identity                |

The noun introduces the topic:
`My brother, ...`
Followed by a matching pronoun clause:
`... he [action/state].`
## Possessive Pronouns

| Person     | Singular  | Plural |
| ---------- | --------- | ------ |
| 1st Person | ma        | our    |
| 2nd Person | your      | yall   |
| 3rd Person | his / her | they   |

### Examples

| GSE               |
| ----------------- |
| This ma guitar.   |
| This yall choice. |
| This they house.  |

## Reflexives
Reflexives are usually built analytically from `(possessive pronouns) + -self /-selves`.

| Person     | Singular        | Plural              |
| ---------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| 1st Person | maself          | ourself/ourselves   |
| 2nd Person | yourself        | yallself/yallselves |
| 3rd Person | hisself/herself | theyself/theyselves |

## Verb Root Stability
In GSE, the root form of a verb is frequently used across multiple tenses and persons, with minimal inflection.

| GSE                | GAE meaning                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| I walk to school   | (Present tense, 1st person)           |
| You walk to school | (2nd person)                          |
| He walk to school  | (3rd person)                          |
| I seen it.         | (Past or Present Perfect, 1st person) |
| You seen it.       | (2nd person)                          |
| He seen it.        | (3rd person)                          |

## Zero Copula
The verb equivalent to ‚Äúbe‚Äù in General American English (GAE) may be absent in non-emphatic contexts. 

| GSE       | GSE Emphatic |
| --------- | ------------ |
| He cool.  | He is cool.  |
| She tall. | She is tall. |

## Question Formation
Wh- and yes/no questions are often non-inverted.

| GSE                    |
| ---------------------- |
| You know him?          |
| What he do?            |
| You goin to the store? |
| What he said/say?      |
| Why you sad?           |
| Where yall at?         |

## Negation
GSE often omits the auxiliary do in questions and past tense. Often tense and negation are carried directly on `ain‚Äôt` or another marker. The `aint`  negator can substitute for multiple GAE auxiliaries (isn‚Äôt, didn‚Äôt, hasn‚Äôt, etc.).

| GSE              | GAE meaning             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| She √µ want that. | She does not want that. |
| She aƒ© want that | She did not want that.  |
| You √µ have to.   | You don't have to.      |

Negation in GSE follows consistent patterns and sometimes features negative concord (multiple negation). In GSE, multiple negatives intensify the negation.

| GSE               |
| ----------------- |
| I aƒ© goin.        |
| He aƒ© never quit. |

## Aspect
In GSE, the aspect marker indicates the timing or frequency of an action. 

| **Traditional Marker** | **Meaning**                                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| be                     | Habitual/regular. The word *be* here is not *is*; it signals an entirely different temporal meaning. |
| b√©en                   | Remote past                                                                                          |
| done                   | Completed action                                                                                     |
| finna                  | Immediate future/intent                                                                              |
| stay                   | Persistent state                                                                                     |
| be done                | A future in the hypothetical past                                                                    |

The sentences usually follow: `(subject) + (aspect) + (verb)`.

| **Example**                                       |                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| He be workin.                                     | He usually works.                                                    |
| He b√©en workin.                                   | He has been working for a long time now.                             |
| He been workin.                                   | He has been working as of late.                                      |
| I b√©en knew that.                                 | I've known that for a long time now.                                 |
| He done ate.                                      | I ate already.                                                       |
| We finna leave.                                   | We are leaving soon.                                                 |
| He stay gone.                                     | He is always away.                                                   |
| Before you realize it, it be done gone elsewhere. | Before you realize it, it will have already left for somewhere else. |

### Aspectual Stacking
GSE allows multiple aspect particles in sequence.

| GSE                        | GAE meaning                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| He b√©en done had it.       | He has had it for a long time (and it‚Äôs finished/over/completed). |
| She be done gone.          | She‚Äôs usually already gone.                                       |
| The cat stay finna pounce. | He's always getting ready to pounce.                              |
| He finna be workin late.   | He will soon start regularly working late at night.               |

## Future Marking
The word *gon* expresses definite or committed future action. It differs from finna, which is usually used to express immediate, proximal, or emerging future intention.
`(subject) + (modal/future marker) + (main verb)`

| Expression            | Meaning                   | Notes                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| *I'm gon call her.*   | Definite future intention | Commitment implied          |
| *I'm finna call her.* | About to call her now     | Immediate                   |
| *We bouta talk.*      | Conversation is impending | Immediate/emergent/imminent |

GSE uses "a" as a future marker following the subject to express near-future intent, usually immediate or definite.

| **Example**     |
| --------------- |
| I'm a call you. |
| He a call you.  |

## Past conditional/modal
In GSE, past modals express unreal or non-actualized past actions. The verb remains in root or simple past form.

| **Example**                             |
| --------------------------------------- |
| I would a went.                         |
| I would not a went. / I would n'a went. |

"Could a" marks past possibility or ability that didn‚Äôt happen.

| **Example**     |
| --------------- |
| I could a went. |

## Conditional Constructions
These forms follow a consistent logic with modals, aspect markers, and ellipsis.
`I‚Äôd go if I had gas.`
## Existential ‚ÄúIt‚Äù & ‚ÄúThere‚Äù
Existentials usually use *it* or *ain‚Äôt no* constructions.

| GSE Standard           | GAE                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| It's a lot.            | There is a lot.           |
| It aƒ© no...            | There is no...            |
| It aƒ© nobody in there. | There is nobody in there. |
